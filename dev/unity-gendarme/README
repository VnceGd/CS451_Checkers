==========   Unity-Gendarme README  ===============
===================================================

The current project is a fork of Gendarme, a .net assembly analysis tool, part of the Mono-Tools.
This project aims to bring the capabilities of Gendarme to the assemblies generated by Unity, and add rules specific to Unity.

IMPORTANT NOTES :

> The Gendarme project relies on the Mono/Cecil library; grab it here https://github.com/jbevain/cecil
The repository clones of Cecil and Unity-Gendarme have to be on the same folder level for Unity-Gendarme to compile.

For example :   /dev/cecil  and /dev/unity-gendarme

IMPORTANT NOTES

* Gendarme "official" build system is based on the auto*/Makefile files
and tested on MonkeyWrench. See mono-tools-trunk on 
http://build.mono-project.com/index.aspx?lane=mono-trunk
(checking out gendarme without its parent dir 'mono-tools' is not supported)

* Visual Studio solutions and projects files (usable by both MonoDevelop
and Visual Studio .NET 2008) are NOT always up to date with Makefiles. 
This depends on the developer making changes and his personal access to 
the developing environments. (Please see the README.vsnet file.)
